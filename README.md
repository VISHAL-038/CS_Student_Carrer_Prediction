# CS_Student_Carrer_Prediction
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the career path of Computer Science (CS) students based on their academic performance, skills, and other relevant factors. The model aims to assist students in understanding potential career trajectories based on their data.

## Project Overview

The **CS Career Prediction** project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of a machine learning model using a dataset of CS students. The goal is to predict a student's career path, whether it's software development, data science, academia, etc., based on their attributes.

### Key Features

- Data preprocessing of CS student records.
- Training and evaluation of a predictive model.
- Use of a machine learning algorithm for classification.
- Loading the trained model using Pickle for future predictions.


## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation and model building.
- **Pandas**: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.
- **joblib**: To save and load the trained model.

## Dataset

The dataset (`cs_students.csv`) contains information about CS students, such as their academic scores, technical skills, internships, projects, and other factors that can influence their career path.
